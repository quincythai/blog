                        Tincy Qhai is the latest and self-proclaimed greatest in a long line of people trying to guide others in living better lives.
                        The difference? This time, Qhai is using a historical precedent as a guide, living a better life through what he calls the 
                        "Gilgamesh Grindset". We've welcomed him onto the times in order to speak a little bit about how you can lock in and live better.

                <p className="J">
                    <b>Jonathan:</b> Mr Qhai, thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Just to start, can you walk me through your patented Gilgamesh Grindset?
                </p>
                <p className = "Q">
                    <b>Tincy Qhai:</b> Yeah, for sure. The first thing you have to know about is the man it's named after. Gilgamesh himself. He's an
                    ancient Mesopotamian hero from the Epic of Gilgamesh, the foundational heroic saga. Scholars agree that the Epic of Gilgamesh
                    basically birthed a whole tradition of epic heroes, from the Illiad and Oddessey to ya boi Tincy Qhai. So in that sense, Gilgamesh
                    was the original.
                </p>
                <p className = "J">
                    <b>J:</b> So what does that have to do with your grindset?
                </p>
                <p className = "Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Yeah, yeah, I'm getting to that. Part of the Gilgamesh Grindset is saying things in a roundabout way. Think about it.
                    The Epic of Gilgamesh was 5 whole poems. It could have been 1, but it was 5. That's the Gilgamesh Grindset. Milk it for all
                    it's worth.
                </p>
                <p className = "J">
                    <b>J:</b> What are some other characteristics of the grindset?
                </p>
                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> It's about getting the method on lock, you know what I'm saying? You gotta find what works for you, and stick with it.
                    Hone it, refine it, polish it. Having the method to how you do life is the Gilgamesh Grindset, baby!
                </p>
                <p className="J">
                    <b>J:</b> Do you have any more... concrete tips? Or is it all a matter of the mindset?
                </p>
                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Oh yeah, I totally forgot about the way that you fuel the grindset. To really discipline yourself, you gotta eat pretty specific.
                    Remember, your mind and your body have to be in perfect harmony. The grindset turns your mind into a machine, a weapon of war, but
                    you gotta make sure that your body is up to the task. That's why I eat a very specific diet. I call it the Gilgamesh Diet. It's just
                    2 things: Slop and Gruel.

                    <b><i>Editor's Note:</i></b> At this point, our interviewer put his head in his hands and appeared to question his life decisions for a solid 5 minutes.
                    Meanwhile, Mr. Qhai proceeded to pull a large bowl of brownish liquid from seemingly nowhere and eat like it was his last meal.

                    <b>J:</b> <i>Almost inaudibly: "My parents were right, I never should've gone into journalism."</i>
                    <br></br> ...slop? And gruel? Is there even a difference?
                </p>
                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Of course there's a difference! Gruel is just food. Slop is what your mom gave me last night though. AYO!!

                <p className= "J">

                    <b>J:</b> <i>Long pause</i>
                    <br></br>Moving on, A lot of your critics have been talking about how your grindset is just a rehash of the "hustle" mentality that's been
                    popularized by personalities such as Andrew Tate. In fact, other books have started popping up about the "Hercules Hustle"
                    and the "Achilles Attitude". What do you have to say about that?
                </p>
                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Oh hail no! You talkin' about my opps? They'll never be able to match the Gilgamesh Grindset. It's the original. The OG. I'm talking
                    about you, Daniel Cho! You'll never be able to match the Gilgamesh Grindset. You're a fake, a phony, a fraud. Ever heard
                    of Gilgamesh fighting the dragon? Yeah, I thought so. That's what I'm gonna do to you if I ever catch you lacking.
                </p>
                <p className="J">
                    <b>J:</b> Wait, the dragon? I thought that was Enkidu. Mr Qhai, I think you might be getting your stories mixed up, no?
                </p>
                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Oh yeah, of course I knew that. Gilgamesh goes head to head against the... uh... the...

                <p className="Q">
                    <b>Q:</b> Yeah, Sauron. He goes head to head against Sauron. And he wins. That's the Gilgamesh Grindset.
                    That's what I'm gonna do to you, Daniel Cho! I'll beat your ass like mfing Sauron!

                    <b>J:</b> Dude, that was from Lord of the Rings. Mr Qhai, have you ever actually read the epic of Gilgamesh?

                    <b>Q:</b> Bro, that's not important. What is important is that you LOCK IN.
